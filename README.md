# Advent of Code 2023

This year I am hoping to use a different language every day in an attempt challenge myself and expand my horizons.  I'm not sure how far I will get!
Please note many of the solutions are unlikely to be particularly good as I'll be attempting to pick up many of the languages from scratch.

A (fairly tongue-in-cheek) blog can be found here on how it played out:
