# AoC2023

This year I am hoping to use a different language every day in an attenpt to learn some new things.  I'm not sure how far I will get!
Please note many of the solutions are unlikely to be particularly good as I'll be attempting to pick up most of the languages from scratch.

Current schedule:
* Day 01: Commodore 64 BASIC
* Day 02: COBOL or Rust
* Day 03 onwards: TBC...
