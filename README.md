# AoC2023

This year I am hoping to use a different language every day in an attempt to learn some new things.  I'm not sure how far I will get!
Please note many of the solutions are unlikely to be particularly good as I'll be attempting to pick up many of the languages from scratch.

Current schedule (with current stars completed):
* Day 01: Commodore 64 BASIC (**)
* Day 02: COBOL (**)
* Day 03: Erlang (**)
* Day 04: Lua
* Day 05: TBC...
